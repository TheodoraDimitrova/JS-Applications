When I’m not chasing babies cooking and playing with food, that is where I am at home.  I think cooking is my kids’ “thing” too, but when it comes to cooking with the children I’m not always sure what to start them on.  Well in knowing that my boy don’t mind getting his hands dirty I asked if he would like to learn how to make meatballs.  He perked right up and headed to the sink to wash his hands.  I should have thought of this earlier, Spaghetti and Meatballs are his favorite!"
